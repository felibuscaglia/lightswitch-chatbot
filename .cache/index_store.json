2024 Update\nBusiness/Product\nThis month, we delivered V1 of Pricing Co-pilot to Quizlet.This consisted of:\nAn audit of their current pricing strategy using historic transaction and\nproduct data\nModels to forecast potential price changes\nA year-long roadmap of pricing experiments to run\nWhy?Longer explanation below—\nWhat tools do software companies currently use to price better?Mostly consultants\nBased on our conversations with companies that have worked with pricing consultancies,\ngetting an answer to “how should we price differently?”can take up to a year.This is\nbecause a lot of firms rely on customer surveys and focus groups to test out pricing\nideas.The output of these engagements can be a fairly static answer like, “according\nto this survey, your customers are willing to pay [$X] for [Y features]”.Can we build a better way to answer this question?So far, yes\nOur view is that when it comes to pricing optimization, companies benefit more from\nbetter/faster/cheaper experimentation than customer research.That’s why pricing co-\npilot works less like a pricing consultant and more like a pricing product manager.We’re adapting the classic PM approach to pricing: analyze a bunch of data, form\nhypotheses, run experiments, and iterate based on what you learn.We turned around V1 of Pricing Co-Pilot in 6 weeks.Here’s what we learned in the\nprocess:\nWorking with transaction and product data is hard, but extremely worthwhile.We\nhave a steep learning curve when it comes to data engineering/data science,\nprobably 80% of our time is tied up here.But the value to customers— in\njustifying our recommendations, in helping us educate ourselves on their\nbusiness, and eventually in developing new tools— is definitely there.There’s already some low-hanging fruit for tooling/automation.For starters,\nmodeling and forecasting revenue growth around pricing changes is a big pain\npoint.Experimentation as our core value prop (versus research) potentially guarantees\nwe’ll be working with Quizlet throughout next year.The experimentation roadmap\nwe’ve put together is not static, we’ll continue to fine-tune future\nexperiments

They define their problems as “we need to\ngrow subscribers” or “we need to increase LTV”, to which our solution is “make\nyour pricing work harder, and we’ll help you figure out how”.\nWhen it comes to pricing optimization, customers want ideas before they want\ntools.\nSelling a service is easier than selling a product.\nWhat 2025 will look like: embracing services as a channel for product development\nThe loosest metaphor for what we’re building is a PM for pricing.
